## Hi there 👋

Welcome to **THD-Spatial**.

We are a group working on practical projects in spatial data processing, geoinformatics, energy modelling, and related research/software engineering topics. This organisation hosts repositories for tools, prototypes, research code, documentation, and reusable templates.

### What you will find here

- Research and project repositories
- Geospatial and energy-modelling tools
- Documentation and workflows
- Reusable templates for open-source readiness and collaboration
- Experimental prototypes and student/academic development work

### Contributing

We welcome contributions in many forms, including:

- bug reports
- feature requests
- documentation improvements
- code contributions
- testing and feedback

Please check the following before contributing to a specific repository:

- the repository `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if available)
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

Some repositories may also use issue templates and pull request templates to make collaboration easier.

### Repository standards

To keep repositories maintainable and consistent across the organisation, we use shared conventions for:

- repository naming
- documentation structure
- open-source readiness checks
- contribution workflows

If you are setting up a new repository, start with the organisation template (if available) and follow the provided checklist and naming guidelines.

### Useful resources

- Organisation templates and standards: see the template repository (e.g. `thd-spatial-github-template`)
- Repository-specific setup and usage instructions: see each project’s `README.md`
- Documentation (if enabled): see each repository’s `docs/` folder or published docs site

### Code of Conduct

We expect respectful and constructive collaboration across all repositories in this organisation.

Please follow the organisation/repository **Code of Conduct** when participating in issues, pull requests, discussions, and other community spaces.

### Notes

This organisation contains both actively maintained projects and experimental/research repositories. Project maturity, support level, and contribution process may vary by repository.

If you are unsure where to start, open an issue or discussion in the relevant repository and ask.
